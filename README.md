## What is uv.lock?

`uv.lock` is automatically generated and contains exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies. It ensures reproducible builds across different environments.

- **Don't edit manually** - it's auto-generated
- **Commit to version control** for consistent installs
- **Regenerated** when you modify dependencies
